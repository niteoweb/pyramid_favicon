``pyramid_favicon``
===================

``pyramid_favicon`` is an add-on for handling favicons in your Pyramid project. Normally,
the favicon.ico file is stored on a web site's project root (e.g. /myproject_root/favicon.ico).
However, with this add-on, it is possible to specify a different location of favicon.ico
via a custom config setting (e.g. /myproject_root/some/other/location/favicon.ico).
